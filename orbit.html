          Scholastic is the world's largest publisher and distributor of children's books and print and digital educational materials for pre-K to grade 12. A main method they supply books to children is through working directly with schools to host
          in-person book fairs. When schools closed because of the pandemic, Scholastic Books could not host fairs, and many children lost the opportunity to get new books.</p>

            Day 2: Our kickoff meeting took us into the brainstorming phase right away.
          </p>
        </div>

        There were plenty of products on the market that provide books to children digitally, but they all require that the child has access to a tablet. We wanted our app to have a reach to more children, particularly ones living in book
        deserts.
        Furthermore, many required monthly subscriptions which are also not inclusive, since many families won't budget for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our refined problem became "How might we get physical books into the hands of children at a very low (or zero) cost to their families?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A deep brainstorm session resulted in both my partner and agreeing that the concept of free-little-libraries might offer us a starting point to build our app from. Free-little-libraries are handmade structures that people create to
          share
          personal books. They are installed along sidewalks in many communities. With this as our largest inspiration, we started to think about our user.

            The results of our initial meeting were fruitful. We were able to nail down user personas, user stories and agree upon a hypothesis. Here's how it went:</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We knew from Scholastic Book's insight that children who are able to select their own books are more likely to read them, however we also knew that parents were the most important influence in a child's life when it comes to providing
          access to books.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to target parents with our app, but through gamification and playful design, children will be a secondary target.

        Our space theme opened us up to a vibrant color palette. To make Orbit even more inticing for kids, we decided to create a few
        game-like elements. One of those elements was a customizable avatar feature. When children get a request for a book, and don't see one they want to swap in return, they can earn coins instead.</p>

        Orbit solves the problem of providing school-age children better access to books by leveraging the books already collecting dust on shelves right in their neighborhoods. Through free book swapping, community book hub hosting, and bulk
        book donations, Orbit ensures parents have a way to find free books for their children while building a community around reading. <br>
        <br>
        Learnings:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Because we were only given two weeks from start to finish for this project, time management was critical. We had to eliminate certain stages from our process entirely such as user interviews. Instead, we relied on articles and
            other online sources for supporting data on user needs.</li>
          <li>
            When submitting our initial project to the competition, it could not be accompanied by any explanatory dialogue. The app had to be intuitive enough that users could figure it out without us to guide them. This was a key benchmark
            that we will continue to use to judge effectiveness of our solutions as we design products in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Future Ideas:<br>
        <br>
        1. Get the app tested by actual users! (This ideally would have happened sooner, but we unfortunately didn't have the time or means to reach parents and children in our condensed timeline)<br>
        2. Dive deeper into accessibility since we didn't have tons of time to explore this with an 8 day timeline<br>
        3. Integrate with Scholastic Book Fairs, or another bookseller to purchase books through app
