        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>While talking with a nurse practitioner, I heard the caregiver's perspective on the struggles her patients have with engagement in their health. </p>

        <h3>"They spend so much time on unimportant things, on their phones... and so little time on their wellbeing".</h3>

        <p>This was the catalyst for my desire to better understand this problem.<br> What tools might be able to support people with their healthcare, and if they already exist, why aren't they working?

        <h1>Surveys</h1>

        <p> I asked 20 people to complete surveys about how they currently engage with their health.
        <ul>
          <li>Nearly 70% of respondants felt that tracking health data was important to them.</li>
          <li>65% said that finding good healthcare was a barrier to better health.</li>
        </ul>
        The surveys brought clarity to the type of health app that might bring needed empowerment to users - a health charting app.

        <p>Six people who already used at least one health or wellness app to track an aspect of their health were interviewed.</p>
        <div>
          <h3> Interview Goals</h3>
          1. Learn how people currently engage with health history and tracking health information<br>

          2. Learn common practices for scheduling healthcare appointments and receiving test results ect. <br>

          3. Find out which health and wellness apps and websites being used

          <h3> Insights</h3>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Most people either use a paper filing system or rely on their doctor when they need historical health data</li>
          <li>The way that users prefer to receive test results is highly variable</li>
          <li>Even indivuals with complex health history do not want to put in the effort to track their health data</li>
          <li>Finding a new doctor is highly stressful</li>
          <li>There aren’t lots of regularly used health charting apps because they are poorly deigned</li>

        <div>
          <p><strong>Feedback from interviews took me back to the analysis phase. Following the Double Diamond Stragety, I was able to narrow the scope and better understand the problem I was hoping to solve.</strong></p>

        <h3>Aha Moment: Maybe thinking an app can make users <strong>want to</strong> be more engaged with their care is the wrong way to go about it. Healthcare is percceived as a chore by many people, not something they enjoy. A more impactful focus will be to make this daunting process of receiving care easier.</h3>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
The Pulse app is a tool to simplify an overly complicated process. It solves the problem of  keeps health data in the hands of the true owners, the patients. It also facilitated easier finding and booking of doctors. With every aspect of a healthcare appointment in one place, patients can focus on their health instead of administrative hassles.

        <h3>Discoveries</h3>
        <p>1. <strong>User feedback can change everything.</strong> They generally felt that healthcare is a chore, and what they need is a way to make it simpler, not necessarily a way to be more involved. Learning this shaped the entire direction for the app.<br>

          2. Phrasing and quick adaptation is very important when asking test questions. I had a few instances where my questions came off too ambiguous or too specific, and the data I received from those usability tests was not reliable. I learned
          how to get better results from my questions the more testing I completed. </p>
        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasis on health data security & privacy</li>
          <li>Concept the app for the provider’s side *This would likely have been built for release simultaneously, as it would be monetized via the provider paying to belong to the platform*</li>
          <li>Integrations with Google Calendar and Apple Health</li>
          <li>Deeper level of accessibility including voice control</li>
        </ul>
