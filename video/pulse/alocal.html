          <h1>What is Alocal?</h1>
          <p> Alocal is a vocabulary word study app that is customizable to the needs of each unique learner.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h1>What makes Alocal unique?</h1>
          <!--begin introduction -->
          <p>Because people study foreign languages for various reasons, the words they want to learn should be tailored to their needs. Using Alocal, they can customize their word library and complete study sessions for words of their own choosing.

          <br>

          <p>Most people wish to expand their vocabulary in a foreign language. Our challenge was to build a mobile app to support users as they study new vocabulary words.

          <h1>Research reveals oportunities in vocabulary study app market.</h1>
          <p>I looked at three competitor apps and recorded their strengths,
            weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Based on this exercise, I decided:<br>
            <br>

            1. Being able to look up words in the app would make it more useful.<br>
            <br>
            2. Personalization of specific words to study would enhance the usefulness of the app for every individual. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> How might we design a mobile app that helps people to learn new vocabulary words?

          <p><strong>User Story #1</strong> As a busy traveler, I don’t have a lot of time
            for structured learning, so the ability to quiz myself on vocabulary when I have a few minutes of downtime is the ideal way for me to learn.<br>
          <p><strong>User Story #2</strong> As a frequent international traveler, I would
            love to be able to catalog specific words
            instead of having to look them up repeatedly,
            so that I could efficiently reference them anytime. </p>

              <li>It also became necessary to add screens to flows in some cases. This
                increased clarity, so, even though it added taps, it was worth it to the user's understanding and enjoyment.</li>

            Alocal’s aim is to support people on their journey to learn a foreign language no matter their skill level by focusing in on the most basic aspect of language - words. Since the library is completely personalizable, the vocabulary words
            within the app will be tailored for every individual’s unique needs. Users can rely on the word library as only a reference, or they can push themselves to memorize new words through study sessions.<br>
