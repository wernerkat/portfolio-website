        <h1>What is Pulse?</h1>
        <p>
        <p> Our given project brief to allow health-conscious individuals to log in to a responsive health and wellbeing app that offers them features to support their health. At the core, Pulse is a place for users to chart their health, find care and interact with their care providers.
        </p>
        <h1>What makes Pulse unique?</h1>
        <p>
        <p>Honestly, the world doesn't need more health charting apps, but it does need one that has easy-to-use UI & UX. Pulse offers this while helping users locate both traditional and holistic care providers, message them easily through the app and save or share important health information directly within the platform.
        </p>

        <h1>Many people don't prioritize their health.</h1>
        <p>While talking with a nurse practitioner, I heard the caregiver's perspective on the struggles her patients have with engagement in their health. I became very curious when she said:<strong> "They expect me to give them a pill to fix everything."</strong>

        <p>This was the catalyst for my desire to better understand this problem. I began by asking <strong>which tools might be able increase patient engagement with healthcare, and if they already exist, why aren't they working?</strong>

        <h1 id="headings">Competitor Analysis</h1>
        <h1>I spent time learning about the health app market.</h1>
        <p>My analysis began as a very broad exploration of digital health product offerings. It made me dizzy.
          <br>
          <br>
          I realized this problem space was vast! <strong>There are over 350,000 health apps according to countless sources.</strong> I needed guidance from users to learn about the health app areas that weren't meeting needs for users.

        <h1 id="headings">Surveys</h1>
        <h1>A quick series of health questions kicked off the research phase.</h1>

        <p> I asked 20 regular app users to complete surveys about how they currently engage with their health.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nearly 70% of respondants felt that tracking health data was important to them.</li>
          <li>65% said that finding good healthcare was a barrier to better health.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>  The surveys brought clarity to the type of health app that might bring needed empowerment to users - a health charting app. I circled back and analyzed a few of these to get started. The few I know of have poor UI & UX, so  I started to see an opportunity area.</p>

        <p>Six people who already used at least one health or wellness app to track an aspect of their health were interviewed to get deeper into the health app problem space.</p>

          <p><strong>Interview Goals:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Learn how people currently engage with health history and tracking health information</li>
        <li>Learn common practices for scheduling healthcare appointments and receiving test results ect.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Most people either use a paper filing system or rely on their doctor when they need historical health data</li>
          <li>The way that users prefer to receive test results is highly variable</li>
          <li>Even indivuals with complex health history do not want to put in the effort to track their health data</li>
          <li>Finding a new doctor is highly stressful</li>
          <li>Bad user experience makes people not want to go use charting apps suported by their care provider</li>

            <h1>A big realization changed my perspective on what users needed.</h1>
            <p>*Aha Moment* Maybe thinking an app can make users <strong>want to</strong> be more engaged with their care is the wrong way to go about it. Healthcare is perceived as a chore by many people, not something they enjoy. A more
              impactful
              focus will be to <strong>make this daunting process of receiving care easier.</strong></p>

          <h1>The Pulse app supports users on their health journey.</h1>
      <p>It solves the problem of keeping health data in the hands of the true owners, the patients. It also
          facilitates finding, scheduling and talking to healthcare providers with ease. When all aspects of
          a healthcare appointment are in one place, patients can focus on their health instead of administrative hassles.<br>
          <br> They may just find they dislike the process of finding care a little less.</p>

          <p><strong>Discoveries</strong></p>
          <p>1. <strong>User feedback can change everything.</strong> They generally felt that healthcare is a chore, and what they need is a way to make it simpler, not necessarily a way to be more involved. Learning this shaped the entire
            direction for the app.<br>

            2. <strong>An app is not always the holistic answer.</strong> I realized that my solution might be best accompanied by smart kiosks. They could operate in secure locations with private booths. The booths might be set up similar to a post
            office, and located by neighborhood. Here, patients could schedule a time to utilize one and either submit vitals to doctors or chat with a nurse live. This could revolutionize follow-up visits and quick care needs on both the patient and
            caregiver end. </p>

          <p><strong>Future Improvements</p></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Build out kiosk features</li>
            <li>Emphasis on health data security & privacy</li>
            <li>Concept the app for the provider’s side *This would likely have been built for release simultaneously, as it would be monetized via the provider paying to belong to the platform*</li>
            <li>Deeper level of accessibility including voice control</li>
